# UEFA BEST PLAYERS - OOP JS, MODULES, AND BUNDLING

## Team Members:
- **Anna Nguyen**
- **Ali El-Maniary**

## Project Overview
For this assignment, we have created a dynamic web page using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in JavaScript. Our project focuses on **UEFA Best Players**, categorizing them into three distinct groups:
1. **Iconic Players**
2. **LEGENDS**
3. **Great Players**

Each player is represented as an object created using a custom class. We implemented **inheritance** to extend functionality and provide a structured, reusable codebase.

## Features
- **Custom Classes & Inheritance:**
  - A `Player` class with at least **2 properties** and **2 methods**
  - An extended class for different player categories.
  
- **Interactive Web Page:**
  - Users can explore players by selecting a category.
  - Player details dynamically update on the page.
  
- **Responsive Design:**
  - Fully adaptable from **mobile to desktop** for a seamless user experience.
  
- **GreenSock Enhancements:**
  - Animations for smooth transitions between sections and elements.
  
- **Modular Code & Parcel.js Bundling:**
  - Code is organized into modules for maintainability.
  - Parcel.js is used to bundle our modules efficiently.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Parcel.js (Module Bundling)**
- **GreenSock (GSAP) for Animations**
- **HTML & CSS (Responsive Design)**
